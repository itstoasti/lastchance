Shared Dependencies:

1. **HTML Files**: All HTML files (index.html, macros.html, weightloss.html, recipes.html) will share a common layout structure, including a header, footer, and navigation bar. They will also share common id names for these elements such as "header", "footer", "nav-bar".

2. **CSS Files**: The styles.css and tailwind.css files will be shared across all HTML files for consistent styling. They will contain classes that are used in the HTML files.

3. **JavaScript Files**: The JavaScript files (macros.js, weightloss.js, recipes.js) will share common functions for manipulating the DOM and interacting with the database. They will use the same id names as the HTML files to select and manipulate elements.

4. **Database File**: The database.py file will be used by the JavaScript files to store and retrieve data. It will define the data schemas for the macros, weightloss goals, and recipes. The JavaScript files will use these schemas to interact with the database.

5. **Exported Variables**: The JavaScript files will export variables such as "macrosData", "weightlossData", and "recipesData" which represent the data retrieved from the database.

6. **Function Names**: Common function names across the JavaScript files might include "getData", "updateData", "deleteData", and "addData". These functions will interact with the database.

7. **Message Names**: Message names used in the JavaScript files for user notifications might include "successMessage", "errorMessage", "updateMessage", and "deleteMessage".
